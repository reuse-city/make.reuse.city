### Open Research {.text-center}

I am investigating how to reduce the prodution of waste in cities and regions, by promoting the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. My specific focus is on collective practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation, seeking economic as well as social and environmental outcomes to benefit local societies. This is all part of my PhD research in an EU-funded doctoral programme called **[OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org)**. You can find more information about it in my **[research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott)**. When relevant, news will be posted to <a href="twitter.com/reuse_city"><strong>twitter</strong></a>. At the moment (November 2021) I am preparing to collect all my documentation in a public wiki.
