### Open research {.text-center}

I am investigating how digital technologies can significantly reduce waste in urban contexts, by promoting the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. My specific focus is on practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation, seeking economic as well as social and environmental outcomes locally. This is all part of my PhD research in an EU-funded doctoral programme called **[OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org)**. You can find more information about it in my **[research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott)**.

I have invited people to co-design and prototype speculative technologies to help assess the potential value of materials, and establish ways in which that value is realised to the benefit of local societies.

    During four weeks (between April 5th and April 30th 2021) I have worked in the open to sketch, discuss, prototype and experiment ideas such as an universal registry of things, as well as various interfaces to access it. Learn more about the lab and how it relates to my research <a href="https://is.efeefe.me/reuse-city"><strong>here</strong></a>.

    This online co-design lab invited anyone interested in discussing and creating around themes such as zero waste, circular economy, maker cultures, regenerative design, critical urban studies and other related fields. As well as providing particular outcomes to be incorporated in my research, I also expected to facilitate the emergence of a community of people interested in such themes and the collaboration between them.
